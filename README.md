# British Informatics Olympiad Solutions
Just thought I would share some of my solutions just in case someone found them useful. I mainly use Python3 in my solutions but I may use C++ if I find it advantageous.

For some questions there may be a test.txt file which I made to quickly compare my solutions against the mark scheme via automated testing. 
There may also be template files which I use to quickly setup boilerplate code and some VSCode config files.
I may sometimes add reusable algorithms to the algorithms.py file at the root of the project, but this is by no means a complete library.

I have also added explanations of how my solutions work at the top of each file, including later parts of questions (like parts b,c,d etc) which seem to be rare/ignored in other repos even though they tend to be the most difficult/interest parts. However, sometimes I will not write out explanations if the markscheme for that year (from the official website) already has a good explanation. 

All of my solutions to the coding questions (part a of all questions) are complete and get full marks. They are usually annotated with comments that explain what I am doing. 

I also try to use descriptive variable names and sometimes write more code than is needed (e.g. explicit if statements) just to make my code extra clear, although I would avoid this in the actual competition in the interest of time.

### Contributing ### 
If you have solutions to questions I have not added yet (I won't bother updating existing ones however) then feel free to make a pull request and I will merge. Please note that solutions must be (at least) to the same standard as existing ones in the same format (ideally using my template files which are available in every folder). Solutions with waffle variable names or without explanations/annotations (in the form of comments) will also be rejected.

### Questions/Bugs/Mistakes ###
If you have a question or notice a mistake/bug in my code/explanations, please raise an issue in the issues panel and I might help you.
