# British Informatics Olympiad Solutions
Just thought I would share some of my solutions just in case someone found them useful. I mainly use Python3 in my solutions but I may use C++ if I find it advantageous.

For some questions there may be a test.txt file which I made to quickly compare my solutions against the mark scheme via automated testing. 
There may also be template files which I use to quickly setup boilerplate code and some VSCode config files.

I have also added explanations of how my solutions work at the top of each file :)
