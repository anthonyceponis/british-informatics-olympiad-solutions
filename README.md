# British Informatics Olympiad Solutions
Just thought I would share some of my unofficial solutions (python3) just in case someone found them useful. I will occasionally skip later parts of questions if the official mark scheme already has a good explanation and I will mention this if that is the case. I try to explain my code/soltuions as much as possible in the 'notes' section and annotate the code with comments. Please ignore the printed execution time because I have included that in my template file for debugging. For some questions, where I have included a test.txt file, I have implemented automated testing for convinience. Finally, there may be some unfinished solutions on this repo so I have included a tracker below that states which solutions are finished and working.
